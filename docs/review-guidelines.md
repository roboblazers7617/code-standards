# Review Guidelines

1. Read through the changes made
    * Check if things seem correct. If anything doesn't seem correct, you SHOULD contact the author and ask why it is written that way.
    * Code that doesn't follow the standards in this document MUST NOT be approved.
2. Test the code
    * The steps to do this can be found in the [Test Guidelines]({% link docs/test-guidelines.md %}).
3. If everything seems right, approve the pull request. If not, request changes and leave a comment describing what changes need to be made. This MUST be done using the GitHub review features documented in [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request?tool=webui).
