# Class and interface names

* SHOULD be a noun
* MUST use pascal case
* SHOULD use full words instead of acronyms

```java
class Robot
class Drivetrain
class Launcher extends SubsystemBase
```

# Method names

* SHOULD either be a verb or verb-noun combination
* MUST use camel case

```java
public void periodic()
public void setVelocity(double velocity)
```

### Boolean methods

* SHOULD use `is` or `has` as a prefix before the function name
* MUST NOT be negated (an example of a negated name would be `isNotSpinning`)
* SHOULD ask a question that can be answered `true` or `false`

``` java
boolean isIntakeLowered() {...}
boolean isFlywheelAtTarget() {...}
```


# Command names

* SHOULD either be a verb or verb-noun combination
* MUST use pascal case

```java
public static Command Shoot()
public static Command RaiseArm()
```

### Command methods

* SHOULD end in `Command`
``` java
Command raiseArmCommand() {/* A command to raise the arm*/}
void raiseArm() {/* a function to raise the arm*/}
```

# Variable names

## Variables

* MUST be a noun
* MUST use camel case
* SHOULD accurately describe the function of the variable without any other context

```java
Motor motor;
double speed;
int velocityRPM;
```

### Boolean variables

* SHOULD use `is` or `has` as a prefix before the variable name
* MUST NOT be negated (an example of a negated name would be `isNotSpinning`)
* SHOULD ask a question that can be answered `true` or `false`

``` java
boolean isIntakeLowered;
boolean isFlywheelAtTarget;
```

## Constants

* MUST be a noun
* MUST use uppercase snake case
* MUST accurately describe the function of the constant without any other context
* SHOULD be declared with `public` `static` and `final` modifiers

```java
public static final double MIN_BATTERY_VOLTAGE;
public static final int CLIMBER_ID;
```

# Importing classes
The following rules will be follwed by classes imported by VSCode. 
* MUST be listed explicitly

```java
import frc.robot.commands.ResetGyro;
import frc.robot.commands.swerve.TurnToAngle;
```

MUST NOT use

```java
import frc.robot.commands.*;
```

# Method / class modifiers

* MUST be given in the following order

```java
<access> static abstract final
```
(access aka public, private, etc.)

For example: 
```java
public static XBoxController driverController;
```

MUST NOT use

```java
static public XboxController operatorController;
```

# Method Order
Methods within a class SHOULD be in the following order.
- Constructor
- Periodic
- Commands
- Getters
- Setters
- Other functions

# Javadoc

* Java classes, methods, and constants MUST have a valid and complete Javadoc entry accompanying them
* Javadoc entries MUST describe the full function of the object they are documenting, even if the description is redundant with the name of the object
* Javadoc entries MUST accurately describe the function of any parameters
* Javadoc entries MUST describe the return type and returned object if applicable
* Javadoc entries SHOULD include any implementation specifics that might be useful to whoever is using the object
* Javadoc entries SHOULD be written in sentence case with appropriate punctuation
* Descriptions of Javadoc annotations like `@param` and `@return` MUST be on the next line
* References to classes MUST be linked to the classes they are referencing to make browsing the hosted Javadoc easier

Examples:
```java
/**
 * Safely sets the target angle for the arm.
 * 
 * @param targetDegrees
 *         the target angle for the arm in degrees
 */
public void setArmTarget(double targetDegrees) {
	...
}
```
```java
/**
 * Gets the velocity of the arm.
 *
 * @return
 *         the velocity of the arm in m/s
 */
public double getArmVelocity(){
	...
}
```
When you hover over a function with Javadoc anywhere in the project it will apear.

An example of what the hosted Javadoc looks like can be found [here](https://roboblazers7617.github.io/2025Robot/).

# Comments

* Code behavior and general landmarks SHOULD be described in comments
* Contributors MAY decide where and how to use comments, but they SHOULD at least describe enough that someone who hasnâ€™t ever seen the class before can quickly find what they need to change and understand the basic function of the class
